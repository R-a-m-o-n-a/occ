## Quick Installation Guide

### Server

**Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

**Run server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   
### Client

**First, add the missing .env file into the client folder**

**Then, install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

Then you can run the application either in development or in production mode:

**Development Mode:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
**Production Build:**

```bash
npm run build
npx vite preview
```
*Please note: Production build cannot be opened by just opening built html, but with the "npx vite preview". Find the explanation <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/troubleshooting#build">in the Vite FAQs</a>.*
